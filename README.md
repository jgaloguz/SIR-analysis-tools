This repository contains a series of analysis tools for studying the bulk and turbulent properties of stream interaction regions in solar wind and magnetic field data at 1 au, as well as implications for galactic cosmic ray transport, using a superposed epoch approach.

These codes were used to analyze data from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft, freely available at https://izw1.caltech.edu/ACE/ASC/level2/index.html and https://izw1.caltech.edu/ACE/ASC/DATA/level3/index.html, for a JGR: Space Physics publication (Alonso Guzman at al. 2025).
Specifically, the data analyzed was 64s Level 2 (Verified) data from the Magnetic Field Experiment (MAG) and the Solar Wind Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM) instruments, and 1-hour Level 3 (Contributed) data from the Cosmic Ray Isotope Spectrometer (CRIS).
The code ran without errors using Python 3.13.1 on linux and equipped with the following additional modules: matplotlib 3.10.0, numpy 2.2.1, and scipy 1.15.1.

See the README.md files within each folder and comments within each program for more information.
