This folder contains files with the wavenumber spectra computed using Taylor's hypothesis in code/process/spectral_analysis_turbulence.py when "convert_spectrum_TH" is set to "True". If this data is to be used by the code/process/compute_diffusion_coefficients.py program, this folder and its contents should be manually copied into the output folder and renamed to add the period years at the end of the folder name (e.g. "_2007-2010" or "_2018-2021").
